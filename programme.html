        <h1>Agile</h1>
            <p>Full details of the Agile manifesto can be found on the following <a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/">website</a>.This information includes four key points supported by 12 principles. Adopting a can-do and collaborative apporach to creating a product.The development teams work closely with the business responding to their needs at the time, rather than attemotin to adhere to a contact for requirements (that may chane). Small steps and regular releases with the being aim to have software that could be implemented into the production environment at the end of each sprint.</p>

        <h1>What happens during a Sprint</h1>
            <p>At the start of each sprint, planning activity take place, to determine the items to include in the sprint. The whole-team activity based on reaching a consensus of how long each potential deliverable will take. 
            <p>hese can be done by t-shirt sizes, 1-5 scale, sprint cards. The sprint length is fixed.</p>
        
        <h2>What is a sprint artifact?</h2>
            <p>Any documentation produced during a sprint.</p>

        <h1>Who is in a scrum team?</h1>
            <list>
                <ul>Product owner - user representation</ul>
                <ul>Scrum master - ensures the Agile values are adhered to</ul>
                <ul>Team members - these can inclide developers, testers and devops engineers</ul>

        <h1>Why stand up during Stand-up</h1>
            <p>Daily stand-up meeting is completed at the sprint board to enable any adjustments to be made. These meetings are 15-20 minutes long. </p>
            <p>Agree the tactics forf the day and agreed set of functions to be delivered at the end of ta time-box(Sprint). rof functionality by customer representatives and a team retrospective to reflect on the previous sprint in order to move onto the next one. </p>
            <p>Agile development means fewer steps and involves the user from the start.</p>
            <list>
                <ul>define iteration requirement</ul>
                <ul>build iteration</ul>
                <ul>test iteration</ul>
            </list>

            <p>People are asked to stand because nobody likes standing for too long it ensures brevity of the meeting, people are asked to stand the sprint board to move their stories or tasks into different columns, there isn't a desk in front of anyone so there is nowhere to hide.</p>
            <p>Team members are expected to discuss three questions, what have they done yesterday, what will they do today and are their any blockers. Team members may meet in pairs or with a manager to discuss any issues raised in the daily stand-up.</p>

        <h1>Types of Review in Agile development</h1>
            <h2>Informal review (buddy check/pair review).<h2>
                <p>The main purpose is detecting potential defects.</p>
                <p>A possible additional purpose could be to generate new ideas or to quickly resolve a problem</p>
                <p>There is no formal process underpinning the review</p>
                <p>It may not involve a review meeting</p>
                <p>It may b performed by a colleague or opened up to many people</p>
                <p>The use of a checklist is optional</p>

            <h2>Walkthrough is another type of review</h2>
                <p>Walkthrough information will be placed here.</p>

            <h1>Flavours of Agile</h1>
            <p>Agile methodologies term is used because there are many different flavours of Agile. The principles of Agile across the variations are the same.</p>
                <list>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Scrum - the focus is on short iterations, hours, days or up to four weeks. The increments are small. Scrum was taken from rugby. 
                        </li>
                        <li>Kanban - Allows easy visualization of workflow, via the usual task board used in Agile development projects. It is not a time boxing tool; it is used to show progress of a single enhancement or group of features, for a to do to a done or done done state.</li>
                        <li>Rational unified process- iterations tend to be loner than scrum with larger features sets.Inception, elaboration, construction, transition phases.</li>
                        <li>Spiral - Dr Barry Boehm created this model. this can include a pro typing model.</li>
                        <li>Lean</li>
                        <li>AgileX</li>
                    </ul>

            <h2>Common terms used in Agile development</h2>
                <p>In Agile the term user story is common when referring to requirements</p>
                <p>Backlog when referring to a set of requirements or tasks by a particular sprint.</p> 
                <p>User representation</p>
                <p>Having this user represented throughout minimises the risk of developing an unsatisfactory product.<p>
                <p>The user representatives are empowered to request changes to the software, to meet their needs.</p>

        <h1>Functional requirements</h1>
            <p>This is a requirement that specifies a function that a system or system component must perform.</p>
            <p>Functional requirements can be specific and will provide detail on what the application being developed will do.</p>
    </article>

    <article>
        <h1>Non functional requirements</h1>
            <p>These are important but not directly related wo what functions the system performs.</p>
            <p>They are generic requirements which can be applied to many different systems. Non functional requirements detail how the application will perform in use.</p>
            <list>
                <ul>
                    <li>instability - installation procedures</li>
                    <li>maintainability - ability to introduce changes to the system</li>
                    <li>performance - expected normal behaviour</li>
                    <li>load handling - behaviour of the system under increasing load</li>
                    <li>stress handling - behaviour at the upper limits of system capability</li>
                    <li>portability - use on different operating platforms</li>
                    <li>recovery - recovery procedures on failure</li>
                    <li>reliability - ability of the software to perform its requirement functions over time</li>
                    <li>useability - ease with which users can engage with the system</li>
                </ul>

        <h1>Types of testing in iterative program development</h1>
        <p>user acceptance tests, operational acceptance tests, regulatory acceptance tests, contractural acceptance tests may orruce either  at the close of each iteration or after a series of iterations. Testing can begin before code is written. Static testing or testing ideation code (before it is written in a language) can help prevent issues and save time and money.
